           Manga and Catholic aesthetics, dark themes intertwined with hopeful narratives. 
           Born from Mexican and El Salvadoran immigrant parents, I grew up in Hollywood, 
           Los Angeles during a time that included the LA riots, ‘94 earthquake, and the 
           redefining of chicano culture. These tough barrios formed unique styles to 
           properly represent these narratives and identities. It was a crazy period with 
           frequent violence, demanding a rough attitude mixed in with some heavy doses of 
           catholicism to keep you from falling into darkness. Hope... that is. Yearning 
           for an escape, for something outside these omnipresent themes, I quickly buried 
           myself in anime and mangas. My style overtime coalesced to form a unique voice 
           that pays homage to my past evoking darkness, hopefulness and a sense of 
           playfulness. In the end my work is in constant pursuit of balance, despite the 
           world’s pull towards extremes. Now living in Boulder, CO my style has begun 
           melding with my experiences as a Boulder resident. Having already lived here 
           before for six years, I have a wealth of locations and experiences to pull from.
